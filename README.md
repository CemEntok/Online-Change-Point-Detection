# Online Change-Point Detection
In time-series data, there are some abrupt changes which can indicate a statistical
alteration of upcoming samples of data. They are called as change-points. The time
point which these abrupt changes occur can give useful information according to the
type of data. In order to detect these abrupt changes, change-point detection methods are utilized. As online change-point detection methods, Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristics Curve (AUROC), 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and
Bayesian Online Change-Point Detection are investigated.  The performances are experimented using simulated
time-series data including two different experiments; Mean Test and Variance Test.
